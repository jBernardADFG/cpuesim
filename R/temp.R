# Outline

# Data structures
# extent -- 
# polygons -- SpatialPolygons -- list(list(lakeline), list(holes))
# count data -- SpatialPointsDataFrame

# fit variogram to the count data
# pick N
# draw q
# calculate CPUE = N/A*q
# simulate CPUE over extent
# crop simulated data by lakeline and hole
# convert into a spatialPointsDataFrame

# sample from the simulated data
# two-stage design
# stratified design

# Calculate CPUE_bar, N_hat, and the associated confidence intervals using a few different methods and sampling designs
# Report distributions for CPUE_bar-CPUE and N_bar-N
# Also the percentage of times the CI's contained the true value
